# Audio Moderation System Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the specifications for an Audio Moderation System, a full-stack web application designed to automatically detect inappropriate language in audio files and facilitate efficient human review of flagged content.

## Goals
- Process large volumes of audio data efficiently
- Detect inappropriate language across multiple languages
- Generate accurate timestamps for flagged content
- Provide an intuitive review interface for human moderators
- Reduce manual review time by focusing only on potentially problematic segments

## System Architecture

### High-Level Components
1. **Audio Ingestion Service**
2. **Speech Recognition & Analysis Engine**
3. **Flagging & Timestamp Generation System**
4. **Review Interface**
5. **Database & Storage System**

## Detailed Specifications

### 1. Audio Ingestion Service

#### Requirements
- Accept audio files in common formats (MP3, WAV, M4A, etc.)
- Support for uploading local files
- Support for importing from URLs (YouTube, etc.)
- Queue management for processing large files
- Progress tracking for uploads and processing

#### Technical Approach
- RESTful API for file uploads and URL submissions
- Background job processing for audio extraction from URLs
- Chunking mechanism for large files
- File validation and sanitization

### 2. Speech Recognition & Analysis Engine

#### Requirements
- Transcribe audio to text
- Support multiple languages
- Identify speakers when possible
- Process audio in near real-time

#### Technical Approach
- Integration with speech-to-text APIs, using Deepgram API
- Language detection for appropriate model selection
- Parallel processing of audio chunks
- Caching mechanism for processed segments

### 3. Flagging & Timestamp Generation System

#### Requirements
- Detect inappropriate language based on configurable rules
- Generate precise timestamps for flagged segments
- Categorize violations by type (profanity, hate speech, threats, etc.)
- Confidence scoring for detected violations
- Low false-negative rate (prioritize catching all potential violations)

#### Technical Approach
- NLP-based content analysis
- Dictionary-based matching with context awareness
- Machine learning models for nuanced detection
- Time-alignment between transcription and audio

### 4. Review Interface

#### Requirements
- Display list of flagged segments with metadata
- Audio player with precise navigation to flagged segments
- Controls to approve, deny, or edit flags
- Batch operations for efficient review
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- User authentication and role-based access

#### Technical Approach
- React-based single-page application
- Waveform visualization with flag markers
- Custom audio player with timestamp navigation
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet use

### 5. Database & Storage System

#### Requirements
- Secure storage of audio files
- Efficient retrieval of specific audio segments
- Persistent storage of transcriptions and flags
- User activity logging
- Export capabilities for reports

#### Technical Approach
- Object storage for audio files (S3, GCS, etc.)
- Relational database for metadata, flags, and user data
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Backup and retention policies

## MVP Scope

For the Minimum Viable Product, we will focus on:

1. **Audio Ingestion**:
   - Support for MP3 uploads and YouTube URL imports
   - Basic queue management

2. **Speech Recognition**:
   - English language support only
   - Integration with one speech-to-text provider

3. **Flagging System**:
   - Basic dictionary-based inappropriate language detection
   - Simple timestamp generation

4. **Review Interface**:
   - List view of flagged segments
   - Basic audio player with navigation
   - Approve/deny functionality

5. **Storage**:
   - Local file storage (to be replaced with cloud storage in production)
   - Basic SQL database for metadata

## Future Enhancements

1. Multi-language support
2. Advanced ML-based detection
3. Speaker identification
4. Team collaboration features
5. Analytics dashboard
6. API for third-party integrations
7. Mobile application for reviews

## Technical Stack (Proposed)

- Next.js with App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Development Timeline

1. **Week 1-2**: Setup project infrastructure, implement audio ingestion
2. **Week 3-4**: Implement speech recognition and basic flagging
3. **Week 5-6**: Develop review interface
4. **Week 7-8**: Testing, bug fixes, and documentation

## Success Metrics

- Processing time < 2x real-time duration of audio
- False negative rate < 5% for inappropriate content
- Review efficiency: 10x faster than manual review of entire audio
- System uptime > 99%
